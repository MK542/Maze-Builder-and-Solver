Stuff to be done:

Add A* algo
Add 1-2 Maze Generator Algo(s)
Make it look nicer (use CSS / HTML / JS   ?)
    Remove instructions from the side in bad panel thing (have a question mark that opens a help menu)
    Add buttons at top to choose different algos instead of having G = Dijkstra, H = A*, etc.
    Remove the 'Mode Text'

Break project up into different files, rather than all in main.py
