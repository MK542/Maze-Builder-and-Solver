Stuff to be done:

Add A* algo
Add a random maze generator algo
Make it look nicer
    Remove instructions from the side in panel (have a question mark that opens a help menu if extra space / info needed)
    Add buttons at top to choose different algos instead of having G = Dijkstra, H = A*, etc.
    Remove the 'Mode Text'

Break project up into different files, rather than all in main.py
